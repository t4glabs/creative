                        <p style="text-align: start;">Rashmi is a firm believer in “be the change you want to see in
                            the world.” As a co-founder of
                            Aline Partners, she is interested in encouraging foundations, individuals, and corporates to
                            “give more and give better” through thoughtful and impactful giving. With nearly 18 years of
                            experience in the consulting and grant-making space, Rashmi combines the rigour of
                            evidence-centric research with an understanding of the challenges and constraints in the
                            non-profit sector. She looks forward to convening diverse voices for collective action to
                            achieve shared goals. </p>
                        <p>Earlier, Rashmi anchored grant diligence, finance, and
                            management responsibilities at Azim
                            Premji Philanthropic Initiatives (APPI). As part of grant-making, she also focused on
                            organisation strengthening through structured capacity development support. In her 15 years
                            of strategy consulting experience at PricewaterhouseCoopers and Avalon Consulting, she
                            engaged with global and domestic corporates in their visioning and strategy development and
                            in crafting strategies for scale.</p>

                        <p>Rashmi is an engineer from Mumbai University and a management graduate from the Indian
                            Institute of Technology, Madras. She is an avid crossword and puzzle enthusiast and enjoys
                            spending her weekends rummaging through the aisles at Blossom Book House or basking in the
                            Bangalore weather at Cubbon Park.
